1 Start registry as a container
  docker run --name lr -p 5000:5000 -d registry
  Note: The above registry image is provided by the docker community
  and once it starts as a container it will create a local registry

2 Download alpine image into our docker host
  docker pull alpine

3 Tag the image with the local registry
  docker tag alpine localhost:5000/alpine

4 Push into the loca registry
  docker push localhost:5000/alpine




Setup of docker swarm
=======================
1 Create 3 AWS instances with ubuntu18
2 Install docker on all of them
3 Change the hostname
  vim /etc/hostname
  Remove the data in this file and replace with Manager/Worker1/Worker2
  Save and quit
4 Restart the servers
  init 6

5 Connect to Manager using git bash
6 To setup docker swarm
  docker swarm init --advertise-addr private_ip_of_manager
  This command will create the current machine as manager and it will also
  generate the token-id that we can paste in other machines to join swarm as   workers

==================================================================

TCP port 2376 for secure Docker client communication. This port is required for Docker Machine to work. Docker Machine is used to orchestrate Docker hosts.

TCP port 2377. This port is used for communication between the nodes of a Docker Swarm or cluster. It only needs to be opened on manager nodes.

TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes (container network discovery).
UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic (container ingress networking). 

======================================================================


1 Create tomcat with 4 replicas in swarm 
  docker service create --name webserver -p 9090:8080 --replicas 4 tomcat

2 To see the home page of the tomcat service that is distributed in swarm
  Launch any browser
  public_ip_of_manager/worker1/worker2:9090

3 To see the list of nodes where these 4 tomcat replicas are running
  docker service ps webserver

===================================================================
1 Start mysql with 3 replicas
  docker service create --name mydb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=intelliq 
                                                    --replicas=3 mysql:5

2 To check on which nodes these three replicas of mysql are running
  docker service ps mydb


================================================================
1 To see the list of services deployed in swarm
  docker service ls

2 To get detailed info about any service
  docker service inspect service_name/service_id
  This command will show the service info in JSON file format
  To display the output in normal format
  docker service inspect service_name/service_id --pretty

3 To delete a service
  docker service rm service_name/service_id

=========================================================================

1 Start httpd with 5 replicas in swarm
  docker service create --name appserver -p 8888:80 --replicas 5 httpd

2 To see the list of nodes where these replicas are running
  docker service ps appserver

3 To sacle the replicas count to 9
  docker service scale appserver=9

4 Check if 9 replicas are runnning in the cluster
  docker service ps appserver

5 To scale down the replicas count to 3
  docker service scale appserver=3

6 Check if only 3 replicas are running
  docker service ps appserver

======================================================================

1 Start redis:3 with 5 replicas in swarm
  docker service create --name myredis --replicas 5 redis:3

2 Check if 5 replicas are runnning in swarm with redis:3
  docker service ps myredis

3 Perfrom a rolling update to redis:4
  docker service update --image redis:4 myredis

4 Check if 5 replicas of redis:4 are running and redis:3 is shut down
  docker service ps myredis

5 Perfrom a rolling rollback from redis:4 to redis:3
  docker service update --rollback myredis

6 Check if 5 replicas of redis:3 are running and redis:4 has shut down
  docker service ps myredis
